<p>兩個變量如果相關 (associated)，那麼它們二者中的一個的分佈是依賴另一個的分佈的 the distribution of one is dependent on the value taken by the other and vice-versa。統計學中如何描述兩個變量之間的相關關係取決於兩個變量的性質 (連續型還是分類型，continuous or categorical variables)。本章討論不同情形下兩個變量相關關係及統計學上的假設檢驗方法。</p>
<p>兩個變量之間的關係除了可以用相關來描述，還可以利用迴歸的手段來分析。但是迴歸分析，和本章討論的相關性分析的本質區別在於，相關分析着重討論兩個變量的聯合分佈 (joint distribution)，而迴歸分析則是要探索一個變量在另一個變量的條件下的條件分佈 (conditional distribution)。因此，相關分析從某種意義上來說是對稱的 (X 與 Y 的相關性等同於 Y 與 X 的相關性)，迴歸分析則不然 (Y 對 X 的迴歸不等同與 X 對 Y 的迴歸)。</p>
<p>另外一個要點是，<strong>相關分析絕不討論因果關係。</strong></p>

<li>如果兩個變量之間沒有<strong>直線的 linear</strong>相關關係，那麼相關係數 <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> 會接近於零；</li>
<li>求 X 和 Y 的相關係數，等同於求 Y 和 X 的相關係數 (<strong>與迴歸不同</strong>)；</li>
<li>相關係數 <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> 沒有單位，並且位置不會發生改變 (location invariant)，如果兩個變量乘以或者除以，加上或者減去任意常數，不會改變相關係數的大小 (<strong>與迴歸不同</strong>)。</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">23.2.5</span> 比較兩個相關係數是否相等</h3>
<p>假設需要比較兩個相關係數，可以繼續使用 Fisher’s Z-transformation 計算相關係數之差的統計量，<strong>它服從標準正態分佈</strong> <span class="math inline">\(N(0,1)\)</span>。很少會碰到比較兩個相關係數，但是偶爾碰到的實例有這樣的：要比較男性和女性之間，食鹽攝入量和血壓的相關關係是否相同。</p>

<p>在實際應用中，其實相關係數的比較意義並不是很大。更常見的是使用迴歸分析的手段比較兩個人羣 (男性女性) 中血壓和食鹽攝入量的迴歸係數 (即，性別對實驗和血壓的關係是否產生了交互作用，interaction)。</p>

<li><p>均數迴歸現象，regression to the mean phenomenon，是指在進行重複測量時，前次測量中獲得的極高或極低分數會在後期測量時傾向於向平均值偏移，即隨着時間的推移，高分者成績下降，低分者成績升高的一種自然迴歸效應。所以在一些臨牀實驗中宣稱自己發現的測量值的變化和基線值之間的相關關係 (correlation between initial measurement and a change in that measurement)，其實是一種自然現象而不是真的存在什麼相關關係，如圖 <a href="-association.html#fig:regre-to-mean">23.4</a>。要避免這樣的低級失誤，可以計算測量值的變化 (<span class="math inline">\(X_2-X_1\)</span>) 和前後兩次測量值的均值 (<span class="math inline">\((X_2+X_1)/2\)</span>) 之間的相關關係。</p></li>
<li><p>有些科學家聲稱自己用迴歸係數來衡量兩個變量之間的一致性 (assess agreement between variables)，這當然是完全錯誤的。兩個變量之間高度相關，和他們高度一致是完全不同的概念 (單位，測量方法，可能都不一樣怎麼可能一致呢)。你完全可以將同一個變量乘以2以後和它原來的值作相關分析，就會發現二者相關係數等於 1，但是二者數值上相差兩倍。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>一般來說，迴歸模型 (regression models) 顯得比 Pearson 相關係數更加實用，能提供更多的信息用於推斷 (甚至是用一個值的變化預測另一個變量的大小)，也能避免上面舉例的錯誤使用。</p>
